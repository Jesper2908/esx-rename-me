First off all rename the folder called: esx-main to something like: [esx]

Go to your `server.cfg` and put this line in your server.cfg: start [esx] Or what you called it.

Go back to your esx folder and open "esx_final.sql", copy paste that into your database. 

Done! Everything should be working now!
